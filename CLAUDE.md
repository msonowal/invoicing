## Architecture Overview

### Core Architectural Patterns

**Domain-Driven Design Influence:**
- Value Objects (`EmailCollection`, `InvoiceTotals`) encapsulate business logic
- Service Layer (`InvoiceCalculator`, `PdfService`, `EstimateToInvoiceConverter`) handles business operations
- Rich domain models with business methods (`Invoice::isInvoice()`, `InvoiceItem::getLineTotal()`)

**Data Model Architecture:**
- **Organization-Centric**: Teams renamed to Organizations with business fields (eliminates Team/Company confusion)
- Polymorphic `Location` model serves organizations and customers
- ULID identifiers for public document sharing (better performance than UUID)
- Integer-based monetary storage (cents) to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Flexible tax system (no enums) supporting multi-country tax templates
- Simple JSON arrays for email recipients and tax breakdowns

**Key Relationships:**
```
Organization (teams table) -> Location (polymorphic, primary location)
Organization -> Customer (one-to-many)
Organization -> Invoice (one-to-many)
Organization -> TaxTemplate (one-to-many)
Customer -> Location (polymorphic, primary location)  
Invoice -> Organization (belongs to)
Invoice -> Customer (belongs to)
Invoice -> Location (organization & customer locations)
Invoice -> InvoiceItem (one-to-many)

# Current Demo Data:
- 8 Organizations across different currencies (USD, EUR, INR, AED)
- 30+ Customers including UAE: RxNow LLC, 1115inc
- 160+ Invoices and estimates
- Currency-specific tax templates for all supported countries
```

### Development Guidelines

**Testing Requirements:**
- ALWAYS run `sail php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing` before running tests
- All Pest tests must pass before commits
- Current coverage: 94.7% (maintain above 90%)
- Use `createInvoiceWithItems()` and other test helpers in `tests/TestHelpers.php`
- **Browser Tests**: Currently fixing authentication issues (see PLAN.md)

**Code Standards:**
- All monetary values stored as integers (never floats)
- Use Value Objects for complex data structures
- Implement custom casts for JSON columns (`EmailCollectionCast`)
- Follow latest Laravel conventions (use `casts()` method, not `$casts` property)
- Avoid associative arrays - use proper object instances for data passing

**Money Handling:**
- Store all amounts in cents (integer) 
- Use akaunting/laravel-money package for formatting
- Default currency: INR (Indian Rupees)

**Commit Guidelines:**
- **ALWAYS run `sail pint --dirty` before every commit** to format uncommitted changes
- Atomic, conventional commits with format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- All tests must pass before commit
- Commit regularly with meaningful messages

### Key Components

**Models:**
- `Organization` - Business entities (renamed from Team) with polymorphic locations, EmailCollection emails, tax templates, and multi-currency support including AED
- `Customer` - Customer entities with polymorphic locations, belonging to organizations (includes UAE customers: RxNow LLC, 1115inc)
- `Location` - Polymorphic model serving organizations and customers
- `Invoice` - Unified model for invoices/estimates with organization relationship, flexible tax types, and JSON email recipients
- `InvoiceItem` - Line items with quantity, unit_price, tax_rate calculations
- `TaxTemplate` - Multi-country tax templates per organization with flexible categories (includes UAE VAT and Excise taxes)

**Value Objects:**
- `EmailCollection` - Immutable collection with validation for multiple emails
- `InvoiceTotals` - Readonly class for subtotal, tax, total calculations

**Services:**
- `InvoiceCalculator` - Business logic for financial calculations
- `PdfService` - PDF generation using Spatie Browsershot (requires Puppeteer globally)
- `EstimateToInvoiceConverter` - Business logic for estimate-to-invoice conversion
- `DocumentMailer` - Email functionality for sending documents

**Livewire Components:**
- `OrganizationManager` / `CustomerManager` - Full CRUD with location and email management
- `InvoiceWizard` - Multi-step wizard for creating invoices/estimates with real-time calculations and tax template integration

**Custom Casts:**
- `EmailCollectionCast` - Seamless JSON â†” EmailCollection conversion with error handling

## URL Structure & Routes
- `/organizations` - Organization management (Livewire component)
- `/customers` - Customer management (Livewire component)  
- `/invoices` - Invoice and estimate management (Livewire component)
- `/tax-templates` - Tax template management per organization
- `/invoices/{ulid}` - Public invoice view (no auth required)
- `/estimates/{ulid}` - Public estimate view (no auth required)
- `/invoices/{ulid}/pdf` - Download invoice PDF
- `/estimates/{ulid}/pdf` - Download estimate PDF

## Important Implementation Details

**PDF Generation:**
- Uses Spatie Browsershot with headless Chrome
- Puppeteer available globally via `npx` (not in package.json)
- A4 page format with professional styling

- Currency enum with symbols and names
- Tax templates per currency (UAE VAT 5%, India GST 18%, etc.)
- Automatic tax rate selection based on organization currency

**Database Insights:**
- PostgreSQL with proper foreign key constraints
- Uses `RefreshDatabase` trait in ALL tests for isolation
- ULID primary keys for public document sharing
- Decimal(5,3) for tax_rate to support high rates (up to 99.999%)
- Currency enum fields for type safety
- JSON email collections with custom cast validation

**Livewire Architecture:**
- Full-stack components handle complete CRUD operations
- `#[Computed]` properties for efficient data loading
- Multi-step wizard pattern in InvoiceWizard
- Real-time calculation updates in UI

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Pest framework with custom test helpers
- 233 tests with 94.7% coverage (Unit + Feature + Browser)
- Helper functions: `createOrganizationWithLocation()`, `createInvoiceWithItems()`
- Edge case testing for large numbers, null values, decimal precision
- Laravel Dusk browser tests with automatic screenshot capture
- Screenshots saved for all browser tests in `tests/Browser/screenshots/`

**Package Management:**
- Yarn Berry (4.9.2) for frontend dependencies
- No package-lock.json (deleted - use yarn.lock only)
- Puppeteer available globally, not as project dependency

**Browser Testing Setup:**
- Laravel Dusk with Selenium standalone Chrome container
- Automatic screenshot capture for all browser tests
- Remote WebDriver connects to `http://selenium:4444/wd/hub`
- Screenshots stored in `tests/Browser/screenshots/`

## Git Workflow
- Always run `sail pint --dirty` to run pint formatter on current changes that are not commited before commit
- Always run tests for both (browser and unit) and make sure it passes before commit
- make atomic isolated commits regulary after each feature or atomic changes are done

## Session Continuation Instructions

**CRITICAL: At the start of EVERY session:**
1. **Check PLAN.md first** - Review current progress and task status
2. **Update PLAN.md checkboxes** as tasks are completed during the session
3. **Follow PLAN.md phases** for browser test fixes (currently Phase 1: Authentication)
4. **Reference PRD.md** for project requirements validation
5. **Run test status check**: `sail php artisan dusk` to see current browser test state

**Browser Test Fix Priority:**
- **Primary Focus**: Authentication issues in Phase 1 of PLAN.md
- **Current Status**: 22 failed, 9 passed browser tests (need 100% pass rate)
- **Key Issue**: Dusk `loginAs()` not working with Laravel Jetstream auth
- **Next Action**: Fix `loginUserInBrowser()` helper in `tests/TestHelpers.php`

**Before ending a session:**
1. **Update PLAN.md** with all completed checkboxes and new discoveries
2. **Commit progress** with atomic commits following git workflow
3. **Run formatting**: `sail pint --dirty`
4. **Note next session focus** in PLAN.md

**Reference Documents:**
- `PLAN.md` - Comprehensive browser test fix tracking
- `PRD.md` - Project requirements (100% browser test target)
- `tests/TestHelpers.php` - Authentication helper functions
